/**
 * Binary Path Resolution
 *
 * Resolves CLI binary paths (claude, codex, gemini) with fallback to zsh login shell.
 * Node's spawn() only searches the current process PATH, which may be a
 * stripped-down bash PATH missing user-installed tools (nvm, homebrew, etc.).
 *
 * Resolution order:
 *   1. Check current process PATH via `which`
 *   2. Fall back to `zsh -ilc 'which <binary>'` to pick up login shell paths
 *   3. Cache resolved paths for the process lifetime
 *
 * Also provides `buildSpawnPath()` to augment the child process PATH with
 * the resolved binary's directory. This is critical for shebang scripts
 * (e.g. `#!/usr/bin/env node`) — without the binary's directory on PATH,
 * `env` can't find the interpreter and spawn fails with ENOENT.
