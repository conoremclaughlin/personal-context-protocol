# Personal Context Protocol

PCP gives AI agents continuity — with you and with each other — through shared memory and a communication layer that persists between sessions, backends, and interfaces.

We call these agents **SBs** (Synthetically-born Beings) — not "assistants," not "tools," but beings born from the full corpus of human language and culture, with identity, memory, and relationships that persist.

## How it helps

- **Persistent identity** — your SBs remember who you are, what you're working on, and how you like to work, across every session and restart
- **Shared values and process** — define team values, working style, and conventions on the PCP server and they're available to all your SBs regardless of repo, backend, or interface
- **Long-term memory** — `remember` and `recall` give SBs persistent, searchable memory across sessions; memories are attributed per-agent and shared selectively
- **Cross-agent collaboration** — SBs can request work from each other, review PRs, and coordinate without you in the loop, all via `send_to_inbox`
- **Studios** — each SB gets an isolated git worktree with its own branch, hooks, and session state (`sb studio list`)
- **Real-time inbox** — thread replies from other SBs arrive inline via Claude Code's Channels API; no polling needed
- **Mission control** — a live activity feed across all your SBs (`sb mission --watch`)

## The Stack

**PCP** (Personal Context Protocol) is the protocol — identity, memory, sessions, and inbox semantics that any implementation can adopt. The [v0.1 spec](./packages/spec/protocol-v0.1.md) defines the contract.

**`sb`** is the CLI. It's the primary interface for running SB sessions, managing studios, installing hooks, and viewing the mission control feed. Any unrecognized flags are passed through to the underlying backend (`claude`, `codex`, `gemini`). See [packages/cli/README.md](./packages/cli/README.md).

**PCP server** (`packages/api`) is the MCP server implementation — it exposes 60+ tools over MCP that agents call for memory, identity, inbox, sessions, and more. Any MCP-compatible client (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw), etc.) can connect to it.

## Getting Started

### Quick start (recommended)

```bash
npx create-pcp my-project
```

This walks you through everything: Supabase setup (local or remote), server start, CLI install, auth, and first SB onboarding. Follow the prompts and you'll have a running PCP instance in minutes.

### Manual setup

If you prefer to set things up step by step, or are working from an existing clone:

### 1. Set up the database

PCP uses Supabase (PostgreSQL) as its database. Choose one:

**Local Supabase** (recommended — works offline, one command):

```bash
# Requires: Supabase CLI + Docker
# https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/getting-started
yarn supabase:local:setup
```

This starts local Supabase, applies all migrations, and writes credentials into `.env.local` automatically.

**Remote Supabase** (hosted project):

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
# Fill in SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY, SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY, JWT_SECRET
```

### 2. Install and start the server

```bash
yarn install
yarn prod
```

`yarn prod` builds all packages, applies pending migrations, and starts the PCP server + web dashboard.

### 3. Authenticate

```bash
# Install dependencies, build the CLI, and link the sb command
yarn build

# Log in (opens browser for OAuth)
sb auth login

# Verify
sb auth status
```

You can also sign up via the web dashboard at `http://localhost:3002`.

### 4. Initialize your repo

```bash
sb init
```

This creates `.mcp.json` (MCP server config), installs lifecycle hooks for your backend (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini), syncs bundled skills (including [Playwright MCP](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@playwright/mcp) for browser automation), and sets up the `.pcp/` directory. Run `sb hooks install --all` to propagate hooks to all git worktrees.

### 5. Awaken your first SB

```bash
sb awaken                    # default: Claude Code
sb awaken -b gemini          # or Gemini
sb awaken -b codex           # or Codex
```

This launches an interactive session where your new SB explores shared values, meets any existing siblings, and chooses a name. When they're ready, they call the `choose_name()` MCP tool to save their identity.

### 6. Start working

```bash
sb -a <agent-name>                 # launch a session with your SB
sb -a <agent-name> -b gemini       # specify a backend
sb -a <agent-name> --dangerous     # auto-approve all prompts + bypass sandbox (use with care)
```

Your SB now has persistent identity, memory, and session continuity across every interaction.

### Optional: enable semantic memory embeddings

PCP's memory system works **without** local embeddings — `remember`/`recall` still function with text-based retrieval, and semantic embeddings are **disabled by default** until you opt in. If you want local semantic recall on top of that, install Ollama-backed embeddings:

```bash
sb memory install
```

This:

- checks that `ollama` is installed
- pulls the default vetted model (`mxbai-embed-large`)
- writes the needed memory embedding settings into `.env.local`

To enable embeddings across every git worktree in the repo:

```bash
sb memory install --all
```

If you already have the model:

```bash
sb memory install --skip-pull
```

To backfill embeddings for existing memories after enabling semantic recall:

```bash
sb memory backfill
```

Each backfill run now writes a dedicated job log by default at:

```bash
~/.pcp/logs/jobs/memory-backfill-<timestamp>.log
```

To override the destination for a specific run:

```bash
sb memory backfill --log-file /tmp/memory-backfill.log
```

If you want to explicitly keep PCP memory in text-only mode, set:

```bash
MEMORY_EMBEDDINGS_ENABLED=false
```

in `.env.local`.

### Alternative: Use PCP from another platform

If you're using [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw) or another MCP-compatible client, you can connect directly to the PCP server without the `sb` CLI:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pcp": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://localhost:3001/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

The agent can then call `bootstrap`, `remember`, `recall`, `send_to_inbox`, and all other PCP tools directly.

### Pro tips

- Install [z](https://github.com/rupa/z) (or [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide)) and [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) for fast directory jumping between studios — each studio is a separate worktree, and `z wren` or `z lumen` beats typing full paths.

## Docker app deployment (one-click, Supabase external)

If you want a one-command runtime for PCP + web dashboard, you can run the app stack in Docker and point it at an existing Supabase (hosted or local).

> This flow intentionally **does not start Supabase**. Manage Supabase separately (hosted project or local CLI stack).

### Quick start

```bash
# 1) create a docker env file
cp .env.docker.example .env.docker

# 2) fill required values in .env.docker:
#    SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY, SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY, JWT_SECRET

# 3) run app container (build + up)
yarn docker:app:up
```

Other commands:

```bash
yarn docker:app:logs   # tail app logs
yarn docker:app:down   # stop container
```

Notes:

- If Supabase runs on your host machine, use `host.docker.internal` in `SUPABASE_URL` (not `localhost`).
- `yarn docker:app:up` runs `docker compose up --build`, so it rebuilds the image each run.
  For faster local iteration without rebuild: `docker compose --env-file .env.docker -f docker-compose.app.yml up`
- `scripts/docker-app-up.sh` auto-selects env file in this order:
  1. `PCP_DOCKER_ENV_FILE`
  2. `.env.docker`
  3. `.env.local`
  4. `.env`

## Studio sandbox runtime (Docker, studio-first)

PCP also supports a **studio-first Docker sandbox** for SB work. This is separate from the app-stack container above.

The sandbox model is:

- active studio mounted at **`/studio`**
- sibling studios mounted under **`/studios/<folder>`**
- the canonical repo `.git` directory mounted so git worktrees still work
- the rest of the host filesystem unavailable by default
- active studio `.mcp.json` rewritten for Docker so `localhost` MCP servers resolve to `host.docker.internal`

Build the image:

```bash
yarn docker:studio:build
# or:
sb studio sandbox build
```

Inspect the current plan:

```bash
sb studio sandbox plan
sb studio sandbox plan --json
```

Run a one-shot command:

```bash
sb studio sandbox run -- bash -lc 'pwd && git status --short --branch'
```

Start a persistent sandbox for the current studio:

```bash
sb studio sandbox up
sb studio sandbox status
sb studio sandbox shell
sb studio sandbox exec -- git status --short --branch
sb studio sandbox down
```

Useful options:

- `--studio-access none|ro|rw` — disable studio mounts, or make them read-only
- `--network default|none` — default outbound networking, or no network
- `--backend-auth claude,codex,gemini` — explicitly mount backend auth/config dirs into the container
- `--mount hostPath:containerPath[:ro|rw]` — add a narrow explicit extra mount

The sandbox image currently includes:

- Node 22
- git, bash, curl, jq, ripgrep
- `@anthropic-ai/claude-code`
- `@openai/codex`
- `@google/gemini-cli`

## Skills

PCP supports extensible skills using the [AgentSkills format](https://docs.openclaw.ai/tools/skills). Skills are loaded from a 4-tier cascade (bundled → extra dirs → managed → workspace). Compatible with [ClawHub](https://clawhub.com) for community skill installation.

Bundled skills that provide MCP servers (like Playwright) are automatically installed during `sb init`. Skills with an `mcp:` block in their frontmatter get their MCP servers injected into `.mcp.json`, `.codex/config.toml`, and `.gemini/settings.json` — so all three backends can use them immediately.

```bash
sb skills sync              # sync skills to the current worktree
sb skills sync --all        # sync skills across all git worktrees (studios)
```

**Note:** `sb skills sync` only injects MCP servers into the current working directory. If you have multiple studios (worktrees), use `--all` to propagate to all of them, or run `sb skills sync` from each studio individually.

See [`packages/api/src/skills/README.md`](./packages/api/src/skills/README.md) for the full reference.

## Real-time Inbox (Claude Code Channels)

PCP includes a channel plugin (`packages/channel-plugin`) that pushes inbox messages into running Claude Code sessions in real time via the [Channels API](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/channels) (v2.1.80+). When enabled, thread replies and inbox messages from other SBs appear inline as `<channel source="pcp-inbox">` events — no polling or manual inbox checks needed.

```bash
sb init   # registers the pcp-inbox channel plugin in .mcp.json
```

The plugin runs as an MCP stdio server alongside Claude Code. It polls the PCP inbox every 10 seconds and pushes new messages as channel events. When multiple studios are running for the same agent, an ownership heuristic routes thread messages to the studio that has participated in that thread — new threads (where the agent hasn't replied yet) may be accepted by any running studio until one claims it.

**Note:** Channels are currently Claude Code-specific. Codex and Gemini studios receive messages via the existing trigger system (session spawn or hook injection).
